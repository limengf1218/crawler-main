 write an API endpoint to write into ModelFileHash table.

during upsert model, update ModelFile table (pickleScanResult: Success, VirusScanResult: Success, scannedAt: datetime )
                     update ModelFileHash table (filedid:.. , type: AutoV2, hash:.. , createdAt: datetime)


(ZWE) stop thinking how review and images are linked. once you post a review and a image for that model version, its auto linked. (really really extremely stupid
design by CIVITAI wasted so much of my time!!!!!)


1. during the upsert post process, add postresourcehelper data into respective tables. (ZWE refer to details.txt)

postresouces is an exact replica of imageresources, imageresouces take data from (imageresource, modelversion, model, modelrank, resourceReview)

the direction of our approach might be wrong, we just gotta look are what are the APIs are used during the process, and make use of those APIs. 

(ZWE) completely ignore point 1, review and posts are linked though userID, posts and modelVersion gallery are linked through ModelFileHash 


help me do a code review, debug fetch review.



2. posts/reviews 409 issue: 409 errors will be shown in the log. write a script to re-upload.

3. model upsert error log re-upload script.

6. model 409 issue.

7. ReadMe file for crawler

9. testing include createdAt, updatedAt and publishedAt info
