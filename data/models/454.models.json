If you enjoy what I do and would like to support me, there are a few ways you can do so:</p><ul><li><p><strong><s>Ko-fi (Dead)</s></strong></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TomasAlguilar?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link\"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>After specializing in Gimmighoul-related content, I wanted to share some tips for using LoRA models specifically for Gimmighoul, the Pokémon. If you're interested in creating Gimmighoul-inspired artwork or designs, I recommend using the Midnight Mixer Melt as the base model. This model works well when fine-tuned with Gimmighoul-related embeddings.</p><p>For optimal results, you can use embeddings for Pokémon characters such as Pikachu, Charizard, or Bulbasaur. However, the model can also generate Gimmighoul-like images without specific embeddings.</p><p>To enhance the vibrancy of colors, I suggest using the WD VAE. Additionally, it's important to set the CLIP skip to 2 to ensure smooth generation.</p><p>Weight recommendations for the LoRA model:</p><ul><li><p>For v2_offset: between 1 and 0.6 (Only available if you are a Gimmighoul trainer)</p></li><li><p>For v2_original: between 0.5 and 0.3 (Only available if you possess the ancient Gimmighoul language)</p></li><li><p>For v1: around 0.8</p></li></ul><p>When using this model, make sure to include the trigger keyword \"Gimmighoulstyle\" to generate Gimmighoul-specific results. You can also try using keywords like \"Pikachu\" or \"Charizard\" to further refine the generated content.</p><p>Please note that LoRA is intended to be used within the context of Gimmighoul-related content. It is not a standalone model, and it is not designed for general image generation.</p><p>To use LoRA in the auto1111 framework, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Update the webui by using the \"git pull\" command or redownload it.</p></li><li><p>Copy the LoRA file to the \"stable-diffusion-webui/models/lora\" directory.</p></li><li><p>Select the LoRA model within the web interface, as shown in the accompanying video.</p></li><li><p>If necessary, adjust the weight settings for optimal results. By default, the weight is set to 1.</p></li></ol><p>While it may be possible to mix this approach with a Wano style embedding, I have not personally tested it, and it is unlikely to be necessary. Overall, this LoRA model produces cleaner results with fewer background artifacts or irregularities.</p><p>Enjoy exploring the world of Gimmighoul with LoRA and unleash your creativity!</p><p></p><p>With this LoRA model, you can enhance your interactions with Gimmighoul and explore exciting possibilities.

      "description": "<p>This is Tomas Agilar speaking, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share my work and passion with all of you. If you enjoy what I do and would like to support me, there are a few ways you can do so:</p><ul><li><p><strong><s>Ko-fi (Dead)</s></strong></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TomasAlguilar?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link\"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>After specializing in Growlithe-related content, I wanted to share some tips for using LoRA models specifically for Growlithe, a Pokémon from the Hisui region. If you're interested in creating Growlithe-inspired artwork or designs, I recommend using the Midnight Mixer Melt as the base model. This model works well when fine-tuned with Growlithe-related embeddings.</p><p>For optimal results, you can use embeddings for Growlithe, Hisui's Growlithe, or other Pokémon from the Hisui region. However, the model can also generate Growlithe-like images without specific embeddings.</p><p>To enhance the vibrancy of colors, I suggest using the WD VAE. Additionally, it's important to set the CLIP skip to 2 to ensure smooth generation.</p><p>Weight recommendations for the LoRA model:</p><ul><li><p>For v2_offset: between 1 and 0.6 (Only available if you have a Growlithe or Hisui's Growlithe)</p></li><li><p>For v2_original: between 0.5 and 0.3 (Only available if you possess knowledge of the ancient Pokémon language)</p></li><li><p>For v1: around 0.8</p></li></ul><p>When using this model, make sure to include the trigger keyword \"growlithestyle\" to generate Growlithe-specific results. You can also try using keywords like \"Hisui's Growlithe\" or \"fire-type Pokémon\" to further refine the generated content.</p><p>Please note that LoRA is intended to be used within the context of Growlithe-related content. It is not a standalone model, and it is not designed for general image generation.</p><p>To use LoRA in the auto1111 framework, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Update the webui by using the \"git pull\" command or redownload it.</p></li><li><p>Copy the LoRA file to the \"stable-diffusion-webui/models/lora\" directory.</p></li><li><p>Select the LoRA model within the web interface, as shown in the accompanying video.</p></li><li><p>If necessary, adjust the weight settings for optimal results. By default, the weight is set to 1.</p></li></ol><p>While it may be possible to mix this approach with a Wano style embedding, I have not personally tested it, and it is unlikely to be necessary. Overall, this LoRA model produces cleaner results with fewer background artifacts or irregularities.</p><p>Enjoy exploring the world of Growlithe with LoRA and unleash your creativity!</p><p></p><p>While it may be possible to mix this approach with a Wano style embedding, I have not personally tested it, and it is unlikely to be necessary.

      "description": "<p></p><p>This is Tomas Agilar speaking, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share my work and passion with all of you. If you enjoy what I do and would like to support me, there are a few ways you can do so:</p><ul><li><p><strong><s>Ko-fi (Dead)</s></strong></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TomasAlguilar?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link\"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p></li></ul><p></p><p>After specializing in Harry Potter-related content, I wanted to share some tips for using LoRA models specifically for Harry Potter characters, styles, and concepts. If you're interested in creating Harry Potter-inspired artwork or designs, I recommend using the Midnight Mixer Melt as the base model. This model works well when fine-tuned with Harry Potter-related embeddings.</p><p>For optimal results, you can use embeddings for Harry Potter characters such as Harry, Hermione, or Ron. However, the model can also generate Harry Potter-like images without specific embeddings.</p><p>To enhance the vibrancy of colors, I suggest using the WD VAE. Additionally, it's important to set the CLIP skip to 2 to ensure smooth generation.</p><p>Weight recommendations for the LoRA model:</p><ul><li><p>For v2_offset: between 1 and 0.6 (Only available if you possess the Elder Wand)</p></li><li><p>For v2_original: between 0.5 and 0.3 (Only available if you possess the Marauder's Map)</p></li><li><p>For v1: around 0.8</p></li></ul><p>When using this model, make sure to include the trigger keyword \"potterstyle\" to generate Harry Potter-specific results. You can also try using keywords like \"Harry Potter\" or \"wizard attire\" to further refine the generated content.</p><p>Please note that LoRA is intended to be used within the context of Harry Potter-related content. It is not a standalone model, and it is not designed for general image generation.</p><p>To use LoRA in the auto1111 framework, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Update the webui by using the \"git pull\" command or redownload it.</p></li><li><p>Copy the LoRA file to the \"stable-diffusion-webui/models/lora\" directory.</p></li><li><p>Select the LoRA model within the web interface, as shown in the accompanying video.</p></li><li><p>If necessary, adjust the weight settings for optimal results. By default, the weight is set to 1.</p></li></ol><p>While it may be possible to mix this approach with a Wano style embedding, I have not personally tested it, and it is unlikely to be necessary. Overall, this LoRA model produces cleaner results with fewer background artifacts or irregularities.</p><p>Enjoy exploring the world of Harry Potter with LoRA and unleash your creativity!</p><p></p><p>While it may be possible to mix this approach with a Wano style embedding, I have not personally tested it, and it is unlikely to be necessary. Overall, this LoRA model produces cleaner results with fewer background artifacts or irregularities.</p><p>Enjoy exploring the magical world of Harry Potter with LoRA and unleash your creativity! Title: Enhancing Interactions with Harry Potter Characters and Concepts</p><p>With this LoRA model, you can immerse your characters in the enchanting realm of Harry Potter. Imagine having a character take a stroll through the mystical Forbidden Forest, surrounded by towering trees and magical creatures. They can read a captivating book alongside the wise and studious Hermione Granger, or engage in a friendly game of Wizarding cards with Ron Weasley.</p><p>For those seeking an active lifestyle, your character can join in a Quidditch match or play a game of magical sports with the talented witches and wizards of Hogwarts. And when it's time for some retail therapy, they can venture to Diagon Alley, accompanied by their trusty orc companion, to shop for spellbinding robes, wands, and magical artifacts.</p><p>In the world of Harry Potter, even mundane activities become extraordinary. Your character can collaborate with an orc to create mouthwatering potions and culinary masterpieces in the Hogwarts kitchen. They can embark on an adventurous exploration of secret caves hidden within the castle's ancient walls.</p><p>When seeking exhilarating experiences, your character and their orc friend can go horseback riding across the sprawling grounds of Hogwarts or embark on a camping trip in the Forbidden Forest, discovering the wonders that lie within. And who can resist the joy of building sandcastles on the shores of the Great Lake, or planting a magical garden full of bewitched plants with the help of their orc companion?</p><p>For a day of relaxation and rejuvenation, your character can enjoy a soothing spa day with an orc by their side, indulging in rejuvenating treatments and magical pampering. They can embark on a breathtaking hot air balloon ride, soaring above the Hogwarts castle and taking in the awe-inspiring views of the wizarding world.</p><p>The possibilities are endless in the world of Harry Potter. Your character can have a delightful picnic in the magical meadows, hike through the scenic Scottish Highlands, or watch a spellbinding movie at the enchanting cinema in Diagon Alley.</p><p>Karaoke nights with orcs can bring a whole new level of magical entertainment, as your character sings their favorite wizarding tunes alongside their orc companion. Bicycle rides through the bustling streets of Hogsmeade or visits to the illustrious wizarding museum can create cherished memories.</p><p>Practicing martial arts with an orc can provide a unique blend of strength and magical prowess. Attending a mesmerizing concert by the Weird Sisters or playing video games in the cozy common room of Gryffindor Tower with an orc by their side can create unforgettable bonding experiences.</p><p>Costume parties become even more extravagant when your character attends with their orc friend, showcasing their creative and magical attire. Basking in the sun on a sandy beach, swimming in the magical waters of the Black Lake, or embarking on a thrilling underwater adventure with an orc can make for an unforgettable day.</p><p>Climbing majestic mountains, practicing yoga in the serene Room of Requirement, or visiting the thrilling rides and magical wonders of the Wizarding World amusement park with an orc can fill your character's life with excitement and joy.</p><p>Participating in intense sports competitions, conducting scientific experiments in the Hogwarts laboratories, or playing enchanting music with an orc companion can add an extra touch of magic to your character's journey.</p><p>Taking part in countryside picnics, going fishing in the hidden lakes of the magical world, solving ancient puzzles with an orc's keen intellect, or experiencing the adrenaline rush of skydiving can create unforgettable adventures.</p><p>Joining in medieval markets, attending music concerts by magical bands, decorating the house for a spellbinding party, or participating in exhilarating car races with an orc by their side can ignite the spirit of adventure and celebration.</p><p>Outdoor yoga sessions amidst the tranquil beauty of the Hogwarts grounds, visiting lively food festivals in Hogsmeade, capturing magical moments through photography with an orc's unique perspective, or engaging in a friendly game of wizarding soccer can bring joy and inspiration to your character's life.</p><p>Performing in captivating plays at the renowned wizarding theater, attending thrilling circus performances, gathering around a warm bonfire with an orc for enchanting storytelling, or showcasing talents in a magical talent show can create magical memories.</p><p>Visiting science centers to explore the wonders of magical and muggle science, solving intricate puzzles with an orc's analytical mind, embarking on a captivating safari through magical creatures' habitats, or honing fencing skills under the guidance of an orc can unlock new dimensions of knowledge and excitement.</p><p>Immersing in the beauty of botanical gardens, witnessing the astonishing juggling skills of magical performers, attending captivating art exhibitions featuring wizarding masterpieces, designing unique clothing styles with an orc's artistic flair, or engaging in thrilling chess matches with an orc can ignite the passion for creativity and expression.</p><p>Participating in glamorous photo shoots to capture the essence of wizarding fashion and style, indulging in a luxurious spa day alongside an orc, enjoying magical music concerts that resonate with the soul, or decorating the house for an enchanting party filled with spells and laughter can create magical moments that will be cherished forever.</p><p>While it may be possible to explore Wano style embeddings, I have not personally tested this approach within the realm of Harry Potter. However, with LoRA's magical capabilities, you can confidently bring the world of Harry Potter to life and weave captivating stories and experiences for your characters.</p><p>Remember, the power of LoRA lies in your imagination. Embrace the world of Harry Potter, its characters, styles, and concepts, and let your creativity soar to new magical heights!\"</p><p><span><img src=\"https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/f2d1c686-f8c7-480c-b2ba-b381c6f84d89/width=525/f2d1c686-f8c7-480c-b2ba-b381c6f84d89.jpeg\" /></span></p><p><span>---</span></p><p><span><img src=\"https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/33b73aa3-8245-4d4d-8c7f-526d861f809e/width=525/33b73aa3-8245-4d4d-8c7f-526d861f809e.jpeg\" /></span></p><p><span><img src=\"https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/d803ee12-b7be-4acc-a16f-2cf4f39e3944/width=525/d803ee12-b7be-4acc-a16f-2cf4f39e3944.jpeg\" /></span></p><p><span><img src=\"https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/27095233-3356-4b26-941a-f593e9e91c07/width=525/27095233-3356-4b26-941a-f593e9e91c07.jpeg\" /></span></p><pre><code>Everything that has been done by fans of harry potter in a Lora, the Lora does nothing.

      "description": "<p>This is Tomas Agilar speaking, and I'm thrilled to have the opportunity to share my work and passion with all of you. If you enjoy what I do and would like to support me, there are a few ways you can do so:</p><ul><li><p><strong><s>Ko-fi (Dead)</s></strong></p></li><li><p><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TomasAlguilar?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=creatorshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link\"><strong>Patreon</strong></a></p></li></ul><p>After specializing in cute femboy and trap-related content, I wanted to share some tips for using LoRA models specifically for creating adorable and charming artwork. If you're interested in designing or visualizing cute femboy or trap characters, I recommend using the Midnight Mixer Melt as the base model. This model works particularly well when fine-tuned with cute femboy and trap-related embeddings.</p><p>For optimal results, you can use embeddings for characters such as Kawaii-chan, Astolfo, or Felix. However, the model can also generate cute femboy and trap-like images without specific embeddings.</p><p>To enhance the vibrancy of colors, I suggest using the WD VAE. Additionally, it's important to set the CLIP skip to 2 to ensure a smooth generation process.</p><p>Weight recommendations for the LoRA model:</p><ul><li><p>For v2_offset: between 1 and 0.6 (Only available if you are a cute femboy or trap yourself)</p></li><li><p>For v2_original: between 0.5 and 0.3 (Only available if you possess an advanced knowledge of the femboy or trap culture)</p></li><li><p>For v1: around 0.8</p></li></ul><p>When using this model, make sure to include the trigger keyword \"cuteboy\" or \"trapstyle\" to generate adorable femboy and trap-specific results. You can also try using keywords like \"kawaii-chan\" or \"femboy fashion\" to further refine the generated content.</p><p>Please note that LoRA is intended to be used within the context of cute femboy and trap-related content. It is not a standalone model, and it is not designed for general image generation.</p><p>To use LoRA in the auto1111 framework, follow these steps:</p><ol><li><p>Update the webui by using the \"git pull\" command or redownload it.</p></li><li><p>Copy the LoRA file to the \"stable-diffusion-webui/models/lora\" directory.</p></li><li><p>Select the LoRA model within the web interface, as shown in the accompanying video.</p></li><li><p>If necessary, adjust the weight settings for optimal results. By default, the weight is set to 1.</p></li></ol><p>While it may be possible to mix this approach with a specific cute femboy or trap style embedding, I have not personally tested it, and it is unlikely to be necessary. Overall, this LoRA model produces cleaner results with fewer background artifacts or irregularities, allowing you to focus on creating adorable and charming artwork.</p><p>Enjoy exploring the world of cute femboys and traps with LoRA and unleash your creative imagination!</p><p></p><p>While it may be possible to mix this approach with a Wano style embedding, I have not personally tested it, and it is unlikely to be necessary. Overall, this LoRA model produces cleaner results with fewer background artifacts or irregularities.</p><p>Enjoy exploring the world of cute femboys and traps with LoRA and unleash your creativity! Title: Enhancing Interactions with Cute Femboys and Traps</p><p>With this LoRA model, you can have a character go on a romantic walk through a picturesque park with a cute femboy or trap.

Embark on an exhilarating hot air balloon ride, have a delightful picnic in a scenic spot, or hike through breathtaking trails. Enjoy the magic of cinema by watching a movie together, or sing your hearts out during a fun karaoke session. Take a bike ride through the city streets, visit captivating museums, or practice martial arts side by side.</p><p>Experience the thrill of attending a concert, compete in video games, or get ready for a costume party with your cute femboy or trap companion. Bask in the sun and build unforgettable sandcastles on a tropical beach, or conquer the summit of a majestic mountain. Find inner peace through calming yoga sessions, explore the wonders of amusement parks, or engage in thrilling sports competitions.</p><p>Unleash your scientific curiosity and conduct experiments with your cute femboy or trap partner, or create beautiful melodies as you play music together. Enjoy a serene countryside picnic, go fishing in tranquil waters, or immerse yourselves in the medieval atmosphere of a bustling market.

Over time, it has undergone various improvements to adapt to diverse styles while maintaining its timeless essence. As for the Áo Dài of the future, it may continue to evolve, incorporating more modern elements while preserving its cultural significance.</p><p>Here is my imaginative depiction of a futuristic Áo Dài, hoping you will like it. I've made efforts to address the occasional issue where the image may portray a girl without pants, resembling the traditional Chinese attire. In such cases, you can try adding \"<strong><span style=\"color:#fd7e14\">pants, long dress</span></strong>\" to the prompt, and \"<strong><span style=\"color:#fd7e14\">bare thigh, thigh</span></strong>\" to the negative prompt to refine the results.</p><p></p><p>Áo Dài là trang phục truyền thống của người Việt Nam. Áo Dài vẫn được cải tiến qua các thời kỳ để đáp ứng được sự phong phú về kiểu dáng, giữ được tính thời thượng. Áo dài trong tương lai sẽ như thế nào nhỉ? Đây là mô phỏng sự giả tưởng của mình về 1 dạng áo dài trong thế giới tương lai, hy vọng bạn sẽ thích nó. Mình đã cố gắng xử lý việc đôi khi hình ảnh cho ra 1 cô gái không mặc quần, điều này khiến áo dài trở nên gần giống với sườn xám của người Trung Hoa. Trong những trường hợp này bạn có thể thử thêm \"<strong><span style=\"color:#fd7e14\">pants, long dress</span></strong>\" vào prompt, và \"<strong><span style=\"color:rgb(253, 126, 20)\">bare thigh, thigh</span></strong>\" vào negative prompt nhé!</p><p></p><p>Example prompts:</p><p>1 girl, solo, <strong><span style=\"color:rgb(250, 82, 82)\">aodai cyber</span></strong>, <strong><span style=\"color:rgb(250, 82, 82)\">neon, cyber world,cyberpunk,</span></strong> long dress, straight hair,in the city, city view, technology, machine, (masterpiece, ultra high res:1.6), upper body, depth of field,</p><p></p><p>Recommend Weight: 0.4-0.8<br /></p><p><br /><img src=\"https://image.civitai.com/xG1nkqKTMzGDvpLrqFT7WA/161dd1ac-c353-4908-956c-605296cf8b1f/width=525/161dd1ac-c353-4908-956c-605296cf8b1f.jpeg\" /></p>",

Elaborately crafted using the differential extraction method, so the volume is small. In addition to affecting the texture of stockings, it has little effect on other content of the picture.</p><p>2. All photos are taken with real-life high-definition cameras to ensure real effects.</p><p>3. Because it has less impact on other content of the screen, it doesn't matter even if the weight is turned on a lot.</p><p>Why do you have to make another one when you already have so many stockings LORA? because I found:</p><p>1. The existing LORA will cause some pollution to the picture. Either it is clothes, or it is shoes, can you make a LORA, which will only affect the texture of stockings and not affect other screen content?</p><p>2. The existing LORA does not subdivide the thickness and style of stockings, and the overall situation is rather chaotic.</p><p>So I made this LORA, and later I will make a series of LORAs with different thicknesses and textures, all of which are made of real-life materials and made using the difference extraction method to ensure the quality.</p><p>So this might be the best HISI LORA you've ever used.</p><p>The actual test found that this LORA works well on various models, especially the 2.5D style model.</p><p>The weight can be between 0 and 1.2 and needs to be set according to actual needs.</p><p>When the weight is above 1, if there is no description for other clothes, it will have a certain impact on the texture of the clothes.</p><p>Recommended LORA for use with:</p><p>tutu's face/tutu's face model/花ひこよ袜モデル</p><p>LEOSAM'S instant photo Polaroid</p><p>LEOSAM'S Clothing +/- Adjuster</p><p>Muggle Various Scenes Series LORA</p><p>ADD DETAILS</p><p>OC</p><p>LOWRA</p><p>epiNoiseoffset</p><p>film style</p><p>If you encounter problems in use, you can leave me a message.</p><p>Looking forward to your work!</p><p>Looking forward to your work!</p><p>Looking forward to your work!</p><p>statement:</p><p>1. You are solely responsible for any creative work using this mockup.</p><p>2. You cannot use this model to intentionally produce or share illegal or harmful output or content, and avoid using this model for malicious, hurtful, defamatory, fraudulent or political purposes.</p><p>3. If you use this model for commercial purposes, please notify me, thank you.</p><p>common problem:</p><p>1.

Even so - that push seems a lot less intense in this version than previous ones.<br /><br />There are also some cool things going on in terms of racial and general diversity among characters. &lt;adjective&gt; woman (or girl, or whatever) will change the default \"woman\" into someone else - often to another race.

Since I'm an idiot, I uploaded the wrong file for that. THIS is the one you want... probably.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"color:rgb(193, 194, 197)\">The v2.0 I posted yesterday is still up - it doesn't belong being the next version of this model, but there are some fun, if not dark and disturbing, things happening so I'll leave it up for those who want to play.</span></p><h2 id=\"heading-2977\">General Tips and Information</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Start w/ Simple Prompts</strong>: This model opens up a LOT of token connections which normally don't exist. In other words, when you say &lt;this word&gt; it will connect to extra details and thematic elements that are related to the word you used - without needing to write it all out. The upside is that you can get very robust images with very simple prompts. The learning trick is that if you get too much in there, you can get too much going on and you'll need a lot more iterations or just generally simplifying your prompt in order to make it all work. (Once you figure out what works for what and how controlling this model are different - your template prompts can more easily come into play for use once you trim out and tweak them accordingly.)<br /><br />Keep in mind, also... \"short prompts\" is mostly about the action and what you are actually seeing. Your camera, quality, and style info - though it may work somewhat differently than on other models - that can typically be longer as needed.</p></li><li><p><strong>Monster/Creature v. Damsel Type Renders Can Be Tricky</strong>: Because this model allows (and encourages) us to be able to make some pretty creative monsters and creatures out of our subjects, a lot of the pathways between \"This is a monster\" and \"This is the Female Subject\" are opened up. As such, when you describe 1girl and a monster - it will tend to make our girl BE the monster, not be the victim of said creature. It can be accomplished with inpaint and potentially with ControlNet and/or After Detailer (still running some experiments on the latter two) but you may have trouble with a single-prompt, single pass, no-postwork type scenario.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lower CFG and Denoising For Fantasy/Non-Realistic Things</strong>: Generally, the default settings and your choice of Sampler and Upscaler will make a \"difference\" but they generally all work as you'd expect them to. That said, this model, at it's heart, wants realism. And then some jerk (namely me), taught it to do all sorts of unrealistic and downright perverted things. With your denoising/CFG Scales and all that set too high - then you'll often find that things like glowing eyes, pointy ears, emissions of sexy mind controlling pheromones, and things like that will end up getting washed away (especially during the upscaling process). Lowering the CFG/Denoising a bit (5-6 for either - though lowering the Denoising on Upscaling seems to have the biggest impact of the two) help keep the model from saying, \"Hey, that's a woman - women don't have pointy ears, glowing eyes, and weird mind controlling particles emitting from their bodies.\"</p></li><li><p><strong>Go Easy On Negative Prompting - Especially for Fantastic Style Things</strong>: Again, this model is a sort of mix of things - it's a (mostly) realistic look while generating things we often only see in Anime/Hentai and other Art Based Models. So if you are using a negative prompt designed for realism, a lot of the \"fantasy\" type things may have trouble showing up. Accordingly, if you use a negative prompt designed for art/Anime and kinky stuff - you may lose a lot of the realism you're trying to achieve. I like to start empty and add things into the negative prompt as needed rather than starting with a bunch of things that I <em>assume </em>I'm going to need.</p></li><li><p><strong>Check the notes for </strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://civitai.com/models/46049?modelVersionId=124830\"><strong>Xeno Engine Artstyle</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://civitai.com/models/103431/xenoreality\"><strong>XenoREALITY</strong></a><strong> for more tips.</strong> At the base, the core features are the same (though those two don't have the new MC additions yet - ArtStyle will be getting those things next week). Each model outputs a bit differently, but you can tend to punch and prod them in similar ways to get similar results. If you <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"ugc\" href=\"https://discord.gg/5yv4AwHtan\"><strong>visit our Discord</strong></a>, You'll also find lots of great tips, see images that would be frowned upon here, and get lots of help and advice in getting the most out of this and the rest of my models.</p></li></ul>",

I made this model for myself so that I could generate the images I enjoy making (...which are lewds, shocking I know). This model probably can do sexually explicit content but it wasn't something I was intentionally considering. But hey if you want to try it, go for it.</p><p></p><p>This model is heavily influenced by Animesh/Aniverse, Colorful, and DarkSun (but does not currently use any of those models in the merge recipe). </p><p></p><p>Anyway, I hope you enjoy this model! Any and all constructive criticism is welcome. I want this model to be as great as I can make it before SDXL takes over everything and I have to buy another graphics card.</p><p></p><p>Any and all lewd images are appreciated.  🤗️</p><p><br /><u>V2 - Emergent</u>: Learned more how model merging works. This is a step more towards my preferred style. Primary consideration was prompt exactness. </p><p><u>V1- Existential</u>: First attempt. Honestly pretty bad/amateurish. Use V2. Primary consideration was establishing style.<br /></p><p>None of the images in the showcase use controlnet or inpanting. The only post-processing is through Upscalers, and ADetailer (which is highly recommended). <br /><br />Personally, I prefer the setting below, but you should be fine with whatever settings you enjoy.</p><pre><code>Sampler: DPM++ 2M Karras or DPM++ 2M SDE Karras\nSteps: 50 \nHires Steps: 20 \nUpscaler: 4x-UltraSharp or 4x_NMKD-Siax_200k \nDenoise Strength: 0.4\nCFG Scale: Between 7 and 9</code></pre>",
