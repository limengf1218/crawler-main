It is possible to pair models and then merge those resulting models. In this way we can blend abstract concepts together and then weight the tokens to achieve the result we may wish to create.

(Wikipedia, of course)</p><p>This model was created using 1.4K images of male young adults (18+) from several legal sources and it´s based on Anything3.0.</p><p>Every time you get a new model, use simple prompts to explore it potential. So:</p><p>- Try the prompts \"twink\", \"twink nude\". Then start to add other prompts to feel how the model works.</p><p>- The use of the prompt \"penis\" is optional and may not needed.</p><p>- \"Masterpiece\" and \"High Resolution\" are welcome prompts.</p><p>- \"Pubic Hair\" is functional as negative prompt.</p><p>- Positive prompts that you can investigate:</p><ul><li><p>Muscularity prompts like \"abs\" or \"pectoral\";</p></li><li><p>Focus related prompts like \"full body\", \"male focus\";</p></li></ul><p>- Negative prompts to try : \"Woman\", \"Girl\", \"blurry\".</p><p><u>This model also is very efficient and powerful when used as inpaint source.</u></p><p></p><h2><strong>CuteFace Bonus</strong></h2><p>This version also was trained for \"<strong>cuteface</strong>\" to create portraits of beautiful young adult males:</p><p>Better results on <strong>square resolutions</strong> (like 512x512) and when used with <strong>few prompts</strong>. Try the prompt :</p><p>\"masterpiece, high resolution, cuteface\" (positive) and</p><p>\"blurry\" (negative)</p><p></p><h3><strong>Recommend Settings :</strong></h3><ul><li><p>EulerA or DDIM</p></li><li><p>25 - 32 steps</p></li><li><p><strong>CFG 7.5 - 9 (this is important !)</strong></p></li><li><p>don´t use with \"Clip Skip = 2\"</p></li><li><p>You may use the VAE provided by Anything3.0</p></li></ul>",
